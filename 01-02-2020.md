Dash Investment Foundation (DIF)

January - March funding proposal (3 months)

**Monthly ask will be 800 Dash for the next 3 months**

In order to maintain the USD amount of funding requested in previous cycles our monthly ask has been revised upwards from 500D to 800D. This represents funding of $40k per month, or approximately $500k per year currently.

**What Does This Proposal Fund?**

These 800 Dash are for only two purposes: 1) reserves and 2) the service fee for fund management.

Reserves are able to represent the vast majority (think 95%+) of this Dash allocation thanks largely to Demelza Hays offering the DIF a deeply discounted rate for fund management services.

**How Much Does the DIF Currently Have in Reserve?**

2,012 Dash. This represents all of the reserve funding that has been allocated to the DIF so far.

**What is the DIF&#39;s Strategy Now That it Has a Fund Manager?**

Please see Demelza&#39;s presentation in the DIF&#39;s Q42019 quarterly report call [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=my-lV4yC6z0). You&#39;ll also hear a refinement of how the DIF measures success, how we&#39;ll report on assets going forward, a review of our contact information, etc.

**Note Regarding Possible Funding Proposal Later This Year:**

At time marker [30:54](https://youtu.be/my-lV4yC6z0?t=1854) in the quarterly report call above, DIF chair Michael Lewis discusses a potential shortfall in 2020&#39;s admin fees -- the ones that were intended to be covered by DIF director Glenn Kennedy&#39;s [initial funding proposal](https://www.dashcentral.org/p/dash-investment-foundation-initial-fundi) in June 2019 when Dash was $154.
 We are currently operating on the premise that the Dash price will recover enough that an additional ask to cover these fees may not be necessary, but want to give you a head&#39;s up regarding the possibility.

_We hope to answer any questions you may still have below._

**Thank you for your servicing Dash&#39;s governance needs.**
