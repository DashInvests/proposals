**Dash Investment Foundation**

In recent communications, both the creation of the Dash Investment Foundation and the election process for the Foundation entity were announced:

Creation: [https://blog.dash.org/introducing-the-dash-investment-foundation-370cafcc48ee](https://blog.dash.org/introducing-the-dash-investment-foundation-370cafcc48ee)

Election Process: [https://blog.dash.org/details-on-the-election-for-dash-investment-foundation-supervisors-25766c55a1f](https://blog.dash.org/details-on-the-election-for-dash-investment-foundation-supervisors-25766c55a1f)

In parallel to conducting the elections, Dash Investment Foundation is now submitting a funding proposal to the network to cover the first two years of operating expenses. By funding the bulk of the fixed costs of the operations for a two year period, we can ensure enough runway to thoroughly test the concept, learn from initial investments, and improve the system over time. The proposed uses for the funds are as follows (all projected expenses are expected to cover an estimated 2 year timeline):

- Director&#39;s fees for a time period of 2 years ($80,000)
- The exact breakdown of the Director&#39;s fees: 2 Directors x 2 years x $20,000 per year = $80,000
- Cayman regulatory and compliance registration and documentation ($15,000)
- The regulatory and compliance costs of filing necessary paperwork and documentation to stay active and current with all regulations and licenses in the Cayman islands
- Legal Fees ($15,000)
- Legal fees are for continued legal support including drafting and amending the Foundation&#39;s governance structure (e.g. articles of association), creating investment contract templates, conducting day-to-day legal tasks as well as engaging in ad hoc legal projects. These expenses are difficult to forecast precisely at the current time.
- Bookkeeping and accounting ($12,000)
- Keeping accurate and auditable financial books, tracking revenue and expenses and determining present value of investments
- Banking and custody costs ($8,000)
- Costs related to bank accounts, wire fees, exchange fees, security and infrastructure costs related to safeguard funds, etc.
- Reserve for incidentals and closure if required ($30,000)

Total costs for all of the items mentioned are estimated to be $160,000 over a period of 2 years. Dash Investment Foundation will submit a supplementary proposal to the network if there is a shortfall of funds (due to the volatility of Dash) or due to unforeseen expenses. Any excess funds will be used towards future operational expenses.

To set funding expectations, in addition to this proposal, the Dash Investment Foundation may submit additional funding proposals to the network over the course of the next few months. These proposals are not certain to be submitted as they are dependent on guidance from supervisors, demand for direct investment requests concerning specific proposals, and the nature of the compensation arrangement with the investment manager (e.g., AUM-based vs. fixed salary). Potential proposals may include:

1. Hire an investment manager for the Foundation
2. Seed an initial asset allocation to the Foundation&#39;s investment program

If you have any questions, please leave a comment for the directors Glenn Kennedy and Casey McDonald in the DashNexus discussion section for this proposal.

Requested funding is as follows for July 1st and August 1st budget cycles: $80,000 USD each month @ $145 per Dash.
