# What is the purpose of the DIF?


The Dash treasury system can create no more than a maximum amount of Dash at month-long intervals. While this model works for funding many of our needs, it&#39;s often not ideal for interfacing with the traditional business world.

Some months, we&#39;re presented with more good opportunities than we can afford to fund. Then during other months, we have more funds available to us than we have good opportunities to put them toward.

The Dash Investment Foundation (DIF) solves this problem by providing the network with a way to save units of Dash over time. Those funds are then ready for use when well-researched, great opportunities knock.

In short, the DIF can act as a &quot;savings account&quot; for the Dash network. We&#39;re here to actively research investment opportunities, and when good ones arise, we&#39;ll come to you (the Dash network) with a governance vote/poll to determine whether you&#39;d like us to use your saved funds to pursue said opportunities.


# What is the DIF&#39;s investment process start-to-finish?

1. Parties seeking investment approach the DIF (if they were not actively approached by the DIF first) and pitch their opportunity
2. The DIF does due diligence on the opportunity to assess its potential
3. If deemed a good opportunity, the DIF submits a decision proposal/poll to the Dash network along with supporting analysis and information
4. If the network decides in the affirmative, the DIF will use its reserves (and any additional requested funds, if necessary) to execute the investment

# What will the DIF invest in, and why?


We&#39;ve chosen the following three high-growth industries because they&#39;re ripe to increase global use cases for Dash. Furthermore, it will be advantageous for the Dash network to have influence (via financial partnerships) with key businesses in these industries, because  **influence often leads to Dash integrations**  which may not have happened otherwise.

Blockchain:
Anything to do with crypto trading, buying/selling cryptocurrency for fiat, and future DApps on the Dash platform.

Payments:
Anything to do with crypto payment service providers, payment terminals/points-of-sale systems, loyalty programs, remittance services, and gift cards.

Consumer Tech:
Anything to do with web and mobile services, household and/or consumer electronics, and related fund management.


# Why is the DIF asking for funding each month?


Reason #1:

A predictable monthly amount makes sure that Dash&#39;s stakeholders, as well as all proposal owners, can budget ahead of time, rather than getting blindsided by a big DIF ask during a single month. The more predictable that treasury asks are, the better masternode owners/shareowners can do their jobs.

Reason #2:

We must prevent a scenario in which the DIF is forced into a breach of contract by the network. This could happen if the Dash network first agrees to pursue an opportunity (for example, via a multi-month funding proposal specific to one opportunity), but then de-funds the agreement before all payments are made. This could happen even if the proposal doesn&#39;t lose any votes over time, but is simply surpassed by other projects which get more support at the time.

Remember that the Dash network is a fluid body — its stakeholders change month-to-month — and the DIF must not risk breaching legally-binding contracts with outside companies due to the network shifting its priorities, which has happened in the past.


# Why 9% of the treasury this month?


This amount was judged as enough to be able to do something meaningful with in the next year or two, but not so much as to be unduly disruptive. Regardless of percentage asked, remember that any funds allocated to the DIF remain under network control at all times. The supervisors and directors maintain a fiduciary duty to the network.

What&#39;s more, 9% is not set in stone. It may decrease or increase over time as the network&#39;s resources change, and as voters develop specific desires and expectations of the DIF.


# What is the DIF going to do next?

1. We&#39;ve already received inquiries from 10+ businesses within the payments and blockchain industries. We&#39;ve informed these businesses that we&#39;re still in the negotiating phase of acquiring capital and a mandate from the Dash network, and that we&#39;ll be able to more confidently interact with them after two or three funding cycles.
2. In the meantime, we&#39;re screening the inquiries we have received (and continue to receive), as well as doing background research on the more promising ones.
3. We&#39;re developing a PR and communication strategy to maximize our impact.
4. We&#39;re launching a poll in the coming days via DashWatch that will ask the network for confirmation of its preference of the asset type(s) in which the DIF&#39;s reserves are stored.

# Final two notes:


1) You will notice that this proposal is being made from a new, generically-named account. The prior DIF proposal (that covered two years of administrative costs) came from account &quot;difkennedy,&quot; while this one is made by &quot;TheDIF.&quot; You will notice, however, that the payout addresses are the same on both.

2) The DIF&#39;s constitution, which is currently under review by the directors, is viewable [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TPewyoDtFf2LEmlvyZ8Lowu55U-P5USajGJNJNeQ5VI/edit).

UPDATE Sept 12: Constitition has been approved by directors.
