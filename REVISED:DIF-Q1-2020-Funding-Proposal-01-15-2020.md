REVISED: Dash Investment Foundation: January - March funding (3 months)

**Monthly ask will be 500 Dash for the next 3 months.**

After internal reflection and consideration, the DIF has decided to rescind its previous ask of 800D. This ask was trying to maintain a consistent intake of Dash as measured in USD value.

The supervisors concede now, however, that this was not a practical solution and will now return to our prior approach of requesting a set percentage of the treasury -- in this case, 9% (as in all previous requests).

**What Does This Proposal Fund?**

These 500 Dash are for only two purposes: 1) reserves and 2) fund management/admin/legal expenses.

Reserves represent up to 95% of this allocation, with the remaining funds for management, administration, and legal. Thanks largely to Demelza Hays offering the DIF a deeply discounted rate for fund management services, we can keep ongoing costs to a minimum.

**How Much Does the DIF Currently Have in Reserve?**

**Correction:** 1,762 Dash. (not 2,012 Dash)

NOTE: We previously stated our reserves at 2,012 Dash. This was a miscalculation, as the 2nd tranche DIF funding for Nov 2019 did NOT pass, therefore reserves are 250D lower than previously stated.

This represents all of the reserve funding that has been allocated to the DIF so far.

**What is the DIF&#39;s Strategy Now That it Has a Fund Manager?**

Please see Demelza&#39;s presentation in the DIF&#39;s Q42019 quarterly report call [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=my-lV4yC6z0). You&#39;ll also hear a refinement of how the DIF measures success, how we&#39;ll report on assets going forward, a review of our contact information, etc.

**Note Regarding Possible Funding Proposal Later This Year:**

At time marker [30:54](https://youtu.be/my-lV4yC6z0?t=1854) in the quarterly report call above, DIF chair Michael Lewis discusses a potential shortfall in 2020&#39;s admin fees -- the ones that were intended to be covered by DIF director Glenn Kennedy&#39;s [initial funding proposal](https://www.dashcentral.org/p/dash-investment-foundation-initial-fundi) in June 2019 when Dash was $154.
 We are currently operating on the premise that the Dash price will recover enough that an additional ask to cover these fees may not be necessary, but want to give you a head&#39;s up regarding the possibility.

_We hope to answer any questions you may still have below._

_ **Thank you for your servicing Dash&#39;s governance needs.** _
